# Startup Valuation Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts startup valuation based on investment amount, funding rounds, growth rate, and industry trends using machine learning models. The models were trained on a dataset containing startup financial information.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful metrics like Investment-to-Valuation Ratio and Growth-Adjusted Investment.
- **Model Training & Optimization**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor (Best Performing Model)
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used GridSearchCV to optimize models for better accuracy.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Allows users to enter startup details and receive a valuation prediction.

## Model Performance
| Model               | MAE (Lower is Better) | RÂ² Score (Higher is Better) |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Linear Regression** | **1.26B** | **0.91** |
| **Random Forest**    | **74.4M** | **1.00** |
| **Gradient Boosting** | **79.5M** | **1.00** |

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Joblib (for model saving)
